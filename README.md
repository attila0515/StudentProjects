# StudentProjects
Summarizes my university engineering projects and coursework

## 1. Fuzzy temperature control in LabVIEW 
### File name: LabVIEW - Fuzzy project
This project presents the design and implementation of a fuzzy logic–based temperature control system developed in the LabVIEW environment.
The system performs temperature measurement and computes the control signal using fuzzy inference.
The repository also contains the project presentation and the full technical documentation.

## 2. Master's Thesis
### File name: Diplomaterv.pdf
The aim of the master’s thesis is to examine the applicability of modern optimization methods in contemporary electric drives. One such technique is the family of swarm-intelligence-based algorithms. In this work, I investigated how classical, well-known control methods can be combined with nature-inspired self-organizing algorithms in the case of a permanent magnet synchronous machine. The goal is to analyze how effectively stochastic search methods can be used to optimize the system dynamics while ensuring stable and cost-efficient operation.

## 3. Practical Application of Deep Learning - Signal Separation Network
### File name: Signal Separation Network
This project deals with axle detection and load estimation of road vehicles using strain gauge measurements installed on a bridge. When several vehicles pass the bridge at the same time in different lanes, the measured signals overlap and become difficult to separate.

The goal of this project is to use a deep learning method to separate the merged sensor signals and extract the signal belonging to one vehicle.  

The project includes:
- a script for dataset generation and preprocessing  
- a script that defines the network  
- documentation

## 4. PLC-controlled manipulator
### File name: Servo-pneumatic
This project implements a PLC-controlled pneumatic XYZ manipulator for automated loading tasks. The documentation describes the working principle of the system. This project was developed in a team of two.

## 5. Line Follower TurtleBot in ROS 2
### File name: line_follower_cnn
This project was developed in a team of four using ROS2. The robot follows a line using a virtual camera and a convolutional neural network (CNN) for line detection.
I wrote the Python node that processes the virtual camera images and controls the robot to follow the line.
