## Fuzzy temperature control in LabVIEW
This project presents the design and implementation of a fuzzy logic–based temperature control system developed in the LabVIEW environment.
The system performs temperature measurement and computes the control signal using fuzzy inference.
The repository also contains the project presentation and the full technical documentation.

## Master's Thesis
The aim of the master’s thesis is to examine the applicability of modern optimization methods in contemporary electric drives. One such technique is the family of swarm-intelligence-based algorithms. In this work, I investigated how classical, well-known control methods can be combined with nature-inspired self-organizing algorithms in the case of a permanent magnet synchronous machine. The goal is to analyze how effectively stochastic search methods can be used to optimize the system dynamics while ensuring stable and cost-efficient operation.
