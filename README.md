## Fuzzy temperature control in LabVIEW
This project presents the design and implementation of a fuzzy logic–based temperature control system developed in the LabVIEW environment.
The system performs temperature measurement and computes the control signal using fuzzy inference.
The repository also contains the project presentation and the full technical documentation.
